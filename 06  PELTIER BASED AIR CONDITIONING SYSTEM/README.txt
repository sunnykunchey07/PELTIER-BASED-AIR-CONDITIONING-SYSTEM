Peltier Air Conditioners
Thermal management for electronic cabinets and kiosks
Peltier air conditioners offer dependable, compact performance by cooling objects via convection. They are commonly used in sample storage chambers for medical and analytical instrumentation, electronic enclosures, and compartment storage for food and beverage applications.

Heat inside the chamber is absorbed by the cold side heat exchanger. The thermoelectric coolers pump heat from the cold side heat exchanger and dissipate through the hot side heat exchanger to the outside environment. The internal air circulation from the cold side fan helps minimize temperature gradient within the enclosure.

The table below contains the Laird Thermal Systems' family of Peltier Air Conditioners. These thermoelectric cooler assemblies feature a variety of form factors and cooling capacities depending on your application requirements.
